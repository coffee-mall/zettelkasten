Human anatomy is the scientific study of the body’s structures. 

anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and other injuries.

Gross anatomy is the study of the larger structures of the body,

microscopic anatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification devices

Regional anatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region,

systemic anatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system—that

physiology is about function. Human physiology is the scientific study of the chemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the functions of life.

Homeostasis is the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things.

Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example, what different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels along nerves).
